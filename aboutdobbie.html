  <body>
    <p>I was born many moons ago (six years ago) and adopted by my human mother, Katie.</p>
    <p>I have spent many years travelling the places she calls "living room" and "backyard." I have claimed both sacred places as my domain, I have even claimed her throne -- or "bed" as she calls it, my own.</p>
    <p>I have the upmost disdain for most things, except for "rubbies" and "walkies". I also do not complain about "napnaps."</p>
    <p>While Katie was once my favorite human, she has been replaced by the human man they call "Josue" who mother says is a traitor for "stealing" my "love."</p>
    <p>I once rode up a mountain inside of the backpack of the one they call "Josue."
    <br>
    <p>I am a dog. The end.</p>
